Description: fast, modern, secure kernel VPN tunnel (metapackage)
 WireGuard is a novel VPN that runs inside the Linux Kernel and uses
 state-of-the-art cryptography (the "Noise" protocol). It aims to be
 faster, simpler, leaner, and more useful than IPSec, while avoiding
 the massive headache. It intends to be considerably more performant
 than OpenVPN. WireGuard is designed as a general purpose VPN for
 running on embedded interfaces and super computers alike, fit for
 many different circumstances. It runs over UDP.
 .
 This metapackage explicitly depends on both the kernel module and the
 userspace tooling, and tries to load the new kernel module upon
 installation, if wireguard is already in use on the system.
